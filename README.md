# My Shell

**My Shell** is a custom command-line interpreter written in Java. It supports basic shell commands such as `pwd`, `cd`, `echo`, and `type`, along with the ability to execute external programs. The shell can handle absolute and relative paths, as well as the `~` character for the user's home directory.

## Features

- **Built-in Commands**: 
  - `pwd`: Prints the current working directory.
  - `cd`: Changes the directory to a specified path (supports absolute, relative paths, and `~` for the home directory).
  - `echo`: Displays a line of text.
  - `type`: Identifies whether a command is a shell builtin or an external program.

- **External Program Execution**: Executes commands found in directories specified by the `PATH` environment variable.
